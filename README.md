# The Devil's Fingers 

A text-based game about finding a way to escape an unbelievably hostile forest teeming with horrors, tucked in the desolate corners of Caledonia County, Vermont in the year of 1987.
	
TDF's core gameplay revolves around exploring the world, interacting with the environment, and fighting enemies by typing textual commands into a console. Unlike most classic text-based adventure games, however, TDF runs in real-time and does not wait for the player's input. Inaction prefaces death.
